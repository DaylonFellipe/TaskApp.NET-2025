# 📋 Summary

This project is a task management application (**Task App**) developed with **.NET** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend.

The solution is divided into two main areas:

- **User Functions:** basic and simple features focused on the end user.

- **Management Functions:** advanced features and additional information for task control and administration.

The goal is to provide an intuitive and efficient platform, allowing both users and administrators to create, edit, complete, and organize tasks in a practical and agile way.
